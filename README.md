# Samsung Wearable Computing Activity Recognition

This project uses data from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone accelerometers to classify human activities. The goal is to prepare tidy data and perform an analysis of the mean and standard deviation of various measurements from the accelerometers.

## Files:
- `run_analysis.R`: The main script for performing data cleaning and analysis.
- `CodeBook.md`: Describes the variables in the dataset and any transformations or cleaning steps performed.
- `tidy_data.txt`: The output tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## How to Run:
1. Download and unzip the Samsung data from the provided link into your working directory.
2. Ensure that `run_analysis.R` is in the same directory.
3. Run the script `run_analysis.R` in R.

## Output:
- `tidy_data.txt`: A tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.
